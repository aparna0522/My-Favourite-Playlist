<b>MongoDB Application:</b>
Connected the node.js application with MongoDB at the backend to store and create database of the users. \
The nodejs application in this case has a username and a singer's name as his favourite playlist. In this the name is not taken dynamically. 
If you wish to create a dynamic application, you need to create an HTML form which will take the inputs as username and playlist(Singer name).
